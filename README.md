#Online-Book-Store
An online bookstore software project that serves as a central database for all of the books in stock in stock, as well as their title, author, and price. The goal of this project is to create awebsite that serves as a central book store. This website was built with Java and SQL on the back end. Various book-related details are stored in the SQL database. A user visiting the website will find a wide selection of books organized by category. The user can choose a book and see its price. The user can even utilize the website to look for certain books. After the user chooses a book, he/she must fill out a form before the book is booked for the user and also performed all the CRUD  operations from admin side.
